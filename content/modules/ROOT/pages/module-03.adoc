= Use Your Knowledge

Now that you have re-deployed OpenShift Lightspeed and pointed it to the 
additional RAG database, you should be able to get answers based on your own
knowledge and content.

== BYOK Enters the Chat

Go ahead and open the OpenShift Lightspeed chat window and then ask the
following question:

[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
How do I use a horizontal pod autoscaler at ACME corp?
----

You should see an answer that refers to the prohibition on autoscalers and the
specific processes required to get one.

Great!

What happens if you ask the question slightly differently? Do you always get
the same answer following the internal policy? You might not. Why is this?

Right now, OpenShift Lightspeed is weighting all documentation as equally
important. If your question doesn't match well enough to the internal document,
the generic horizontal pod autoscaling (HPA) documentation may score higher
on the internal search result, which means the internal policy document
isn't used.

We understand that this isn't optimal, and we are working on making sure that
OpenShift Lightspeed _prefers_ your internal documentation sources.

Try asking queestions about adding GPU nodes and see if you can get a response
based on the internal documentation.

== Extra Credit

Try creating your own internal "documentation", rebuilding the RAG database,
re-pushing the image, and seeing how that knowledge can be added to OpenShift
Lightspeed responses.

== Extra Extra Credit

OpenShift Lightspeed internally logs the conversations and requests to the 
model provider. Look at the logs of the OpenShift Lightspeed API server pod when
asking questions so that you can see how the documentation is included and 
sent with the user's question.
