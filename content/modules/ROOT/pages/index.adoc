OpenShift Lightspeed is a virtual assistant for the Red Hat OpenShift Container
Platform. It helps users with general knowledge, troubleshooting, skill
development, root cause analysis, and more. Powered by large language models
(LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), OpenShift Lightspeed makes
OpenShift more accessible to users and helps increase user productivity.

== OpenShift Lightspeed Architecture
OpenShift Lightspeed today is a relatively small and lightweight system that
you deploy into each OpenShift Container Platform cluster. The operator deploys
three components:

* A web console plugin (the chat interface)
* A back-end server (the chat interface calls the server)
* A PostgreSQL database (for temporary conversation caching)

You can also see that OpenShift Lightspeed talks to a model provider. In the
case of this lab environment, that provider is Azure OpenAI using the GPT-4o
model.

The little green box says RAG which stands for retrieval-augmented generation.


== RAG Basics
RAG is a way of providing additional context to an LLM to help improve the
quality of responses. When relying on only the LLM, two common problems can
arise:

1. Hallucination - the model invents an answer that is not grounded in fact,
  even when the model was trained with the answer 
2. Missing data - the model was
  never trained on the required information in the first place, so answers could
  be anything

When providing contextual information to the LLM at the time of asking a
question, the response quality can be dramatically improved, even if the model
was never trained on the specific contextual information.

OpenShift Lightspeed will grab the relevant OpenShift Container Platform
documentation to match the cluster version when it deploys, and it uses that
documentation as the additional context for answering user questions.

The specific details of vector databases and embedding and encoding are outside
the scope of this lab.

Now, with your understanding of the fundamentals, let's try and use OpenShift
Lightspeed.
